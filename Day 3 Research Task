Day-3 Research Task

1] 502 BadGateway error:

A 502 Bad Gateway error typically means that one server on the internet received an invalid response from another server. 
HTTP status code from the 5xx class, which indicates server-side errors.
For Example: You (the browser) ask Server A (like Nginx) for something.
Server A then tries to ask Server B (your actual website/app server) for the real answer.
But Server B doesn’t reply properly…
So Server A gives up and shows: 502 Bad Gateway.

2]In my Employee class, I declared empId as a variable, but when I use getEmpId(), why does it become capital?

Java follows a naming rule for getter methods — and tools like IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) auto-generate them using this rule:
If your variable is called empId, then the getter method becomes:
getEmpId()  
Even though the variable is empId (with a small 'e'), the method name capitalizes the first letter of the variable name after get.
"Capitalize the first letter of the field name when generating getXxx() or setXxx()."
