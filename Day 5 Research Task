1. .build() 

Answer:

 =>User.builder() is used to construct a UserDetails object step-by-step.

 =>You set values like:
     .username("admin")
     .password("pass")
     .roles("ADMIN")

 =>The object isn't created until .build() is called.

 =>.build() finalizes and returns the UserDetails object.

 =>Without .build(), you just have a configuration in progress — not a usable user object.


2. CSRF

Answer:

 =>CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery.

 =>It’s an attack where a malicious site tricks a user’s browser into making an unwanted request to a different site where the user is already logged in.
    
 =>Example: A fake site silently triggers a money transfer request on your bank account while you're logged in.


How is CSRF prevented?

 =>Websites include a hidden CSRF token in forms.

 =>This token is checked with each request to confirm it’s coming from a legitimate source.

 =>If the token is missing or incorrect, the request is blocked.


Spring Security and CSRF:

 =>Spring Security enables CSRF protection by default for web applications.

 =>If you are building a REST API (stateless, not using cookies/sessions), you can disable CSRF with:
           http.csrf().disable();

 =>This is safe only if you're not relying on browser-based authentication (like session cookies).
