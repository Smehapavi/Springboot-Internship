Day-2 Research Task 

A stateless API means the server does not remember anything about previous requests from a client.
A stateful API means the server remembers things about you — like your session, login, etc.

So why not use Stateful APIs?

Need to store data for each user in memory
Are hard to scale with many users
Don’t work well in distributed systems like the cloud
Cause session problems if one server fails or restarts

How to Use a Stateful API?

1. Server Creates a Session After Login
2. Client Automatically Sends Session with Every Request
3. Server Uses Session Data (State-Memory)
